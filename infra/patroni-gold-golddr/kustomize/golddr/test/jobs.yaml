# The Patroni config on GoldDR needs to communicate with Gold through the TransportService, but GoldDR doesn't know anything about the TransportService.
# It's only aware of the resulting Service that's produced that talks back to Gold. So we've created a startup JOB on GoldDR that's designed to
# query the service to get the port number for that service.  It can then inject that port number into the patroni config.
# This id done bt updating the patroni-config configmap directly to include the TS port that the TSC created. This can only be done at runtime, not at "helm time".
# Consideration was made to have this config done from inside the PSQL container, however this would have required the install of OC cli which
# was felt would open a secuirty risk.
# Additional consideration was given to creating a init sidecar to do this config change. That's still a possability, however it would require additional
# long running resoruces for the pod...that would go unused for vast majority of the pods lifetime.
