  description: >-
    This Task builds source into a container image using Google's kaniko tool.

    Kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each
    command within a Dockerfile completely in userspace. This enables
    building container images in environments that can't easily or
    securely run a Docker daemon, such as a standard Kubernetes cluster.

  params:
  - name: IMAGE
    description: Name (reference) of the image to build.
  - name: DOCKERFILE
    description: Path to the Dockerfile to build.
    default: ./Dockerfile
  - name: CONTEXT
    description: The build context used by Kaniko.
    default: ./
  - name: EXTRA_ARGS
    type: array
    default: []
  - name: BUILDER_IMAGE
    description: The image on which builds will run (default is v1.5.1)
    default: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v1.5.1@sha256:c6166717f7fe0b7da44908c986137ecfeab21f31ec3992f6e128fff8a94be8a5

  results:
  - name: IMAGE-DIGEST
    description: Digest of the image just built.
