      Private Practice Access to FH Secure Messaging via MS Teams Privacy and Security Declaration<br><br>
      Secure Messaging from your private practice may provide you and clinic staff with direct access to
      a significant amount of clinical data about your patients from within BC Health Authorities and Ministry
      of Health systems. This data (along with data from your own EMR) can be targeted by organized criminals
      and data breaches can have a significant impact on your clinic and wider system, potentially harming your
      reputation and reducing patient trust. Implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards reduces
      the risk of patient information breaches. This document details the requirements for granting access to
      FH secure messaging via MS Teams, and is informed by provincial legislation (PIPA - Personal Information
      Protection Act), the Privacy and Security Toolkit created by the Doctors of BC, the College of Physicians
      and Surgeons, and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, and Ministry of Health and Fraser
      Health Privacy and Security resources.<br><br>

      <ol>
        <li>I am the member of my clinic staff who is ultimately responsible for maintaining user access and our
          privacy and security policies.</li><br>
        <li>Documented privacy and security policies are communicated to all staff and external parties (e.g. vendors,
          suppliers, and partners) who have access to the clinic's computer systems.</li><br>
        <li>Security awareness training is provided to clinic staff and reviewed yearly.</li><br>
        <li>My staff is aware of malicious emails and have been informed not to click links or open attachments that
          appear suspicious.</li><br>
        <li>My staff is aware of risks associated with using USB drives and other portable devices that may compromise
          my network.</li><br>
        <li>My staff is aware that passwords used for access to MS Teams are not permitted to be shared with other
          individuals or re-used for other services, and that the "Save Password" feature in browsers is not utilized to
          access MS Teams.</li><br>
        <li>My clinic agrees to notify the FH eHealth Team when one of my staff no longer requires access to MS Teams.</li><br>
        <li>My clinic will retain a record for two years of the support activities (e.g. invoice/receipt with name of vendor
          and date of service) of all technical support provided by external vendors that have been conducted on computers that
          access MS Teams or my clinic's network, either directly or remotely.</li><br>
        <li>I acknowledge that my IT Support and/or myself have completed the Private Practice Clinic IT Security Checklist
          and ensured all technical requirements for accessing MS Teams have been addressed.</li><br><br>
      </ol>
      I further acknowledge that:<br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>My clinic's use of MS Teams will be audited by the FH Privacy Office. If a breach is suspected, my clinic will cooperate
          with FH staff in the investigation.</li><br>
        <li>My clinic may be selected to participate in a Privacy and Security Review conducted by the Doctors of BC's Doctors Technology
          Office, on behalf of the Ministry of Health. The purpose is to enhance educational and support process, and program evaluation.
          The findings will be anonymized.</li><br>

        Physician Office IT Security Guide</a>
      outlines basic administrative, physical and technological safeguards you take to implement
      with the help of your Local IT provider in your practice. Most relevant tools can be found under the Physician Office IT Security
      and the Physician Privacy Tool Kit section of the Doctors Technology Office Website.<br><br>
      <strong>Privacy & Security Declaration Information:</strong><br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) requires that each clinic identifies the most responsible physician and appoints
          them as the Privacy Officer accountable for privacy and security. Security measures can be delegated to others such as your
          local IT. The Privacy Officer is also responsible for establishing the Privacy Policy and Security Policies, procedures, and
          forms. For more information, on this role, refer to the BC Physician Privacy Toolkit: A Guide for Physicians.</li><br>
        <li>Privacy and Security Policies and related documents should be communicated to staff and any individuals accessing the
          clinic eSystems. Assistance in creating such policies is available from the Doctors of BC.</li><br>
        <li> All clinic staff need to complete Privacy Training and Security Awareness Training comprised of new employee orientation and
          regularly scheduled refreshers. The content should include:<br>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Privacy and Security policies and related procedures including any changes introduced.</li>
            <li>Overview of the clinic's security safeguards and staff responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Risk mitigation strategies to protect patient information security.</li>
            <li>Steps required for managing a breach in emergency situations.</li>
          </ol>
        </li><br>
        <li>Clinic should provide employees with instructions for e-mails, text messaging, and web browsing. These guidelines must alert staff
          to possible fraud and prevent them from clicking on attachments or links that can download malicious software (malware) to be installed
          on the user's computer and potentially spread to the entire network.</li><br>
        <li>Use of non-encrypted USB drives and mobile storage devices to store or transfer patient information is not recommended. If not properly
          protected, they can be compromised (lost or stolen) or be intercepted with malware. Malicious software can be spread to user's computer and
          potentially entire network.</li><br>
        <li>Clinic should provide employees with instructions about password protection practises to reduce the risk of unauthorized access into the
          eHealth application. Passwords must not be shared with others even as temporary workaround and not used for access to any other services (e.g.
          Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn). The "save password" feature for any account is not safe because any user on that computer can then use the stored
          password. Each user should change their passwords semi-annually. See password management requirements on page 3 of this guide. For tips on
          creating secure passwords, visit the Physician Office IT Security Guide.</li><br>
        <li>Notifying the FHA mHealth Secure Messaging Team ensures that FH access accounts remain current. This will prevent the risk of someone accessing
          information to which they are no longer eligible. To contact the Secure Messaging Team, email
          <a href="mailto:${this.config.emails.msTeamsSupport}">${this.config.emails.msTeamsSupport}</a>.</li><br>
        <li>During the course of providing technical support, there is a chance that unauthorized access to clinical information can occur. Keep invoices
          and/or service receipts for at least two years. In case of a privacy breach or investigation, the clinic should be able to provide details about
          technology and physical safeguards implemented. Refer to the DTO Health Technology Guide - Selecting IT Support for what can be expected from your
          IT service provider.</li><br>
