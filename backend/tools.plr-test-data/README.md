# PLR Test Data CLI Tool

This tool is used to seed the PLR microservice's database with test data for local development.
The data is generated by enumerating all combinations of test cards + college identifiers + PLR "statuses".
By default, the tool targets a locally hosted database on port 5433 (the default for this project). An alternate connection string can be passed into the command's first (optional) argument.

## Installation
The tool must be packaged locally and installed before first use. This same procedure can also be used to update the tool to a new version.
In this folder, invoke `dotnet pack` to create the NuGet package, then `dotnet tool install plr-test-data --add-source .\nupkg\` to install the package.

## Use
The tool can be invoked with `dotnet plr-test-data` in any backend folder. Use `dotnet plr-test-data <Connection String>` to target a database other than the default.

## Updating Versions
When updating the tool, please be sure to increment the version prefix in the `.csproj` to make sure the correct version is installed.

## Troubleshooting
Note that the package in the `nupkg` folder is not accessed after installation; any modifications to that package file will not be seen when invoking the tool using `dotnet plr-test-data`.
The tool is cached in `%UserProfile%\.nuget\packages\plr-test-data`.
